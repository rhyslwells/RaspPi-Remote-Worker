## Overview

**Chess Game Analysis Dashboard** is a Streamlit-based analytical application for examining historical chess games from Chess.com. It provides an on-demand environment for retrieving game data, computing derived performance metrics, and exploring historical patterns through an interactive interface.

The application accepts **any Chess.com username**, retrieves publicly available games, and performs all analysis locally. No API keys, background services, or continuous updates are required.

## Features

### Game Ingestion

* On-demand retrieval of historical games from the Chess.com public API
* Optional date range filtering
* Incremental ingestion with local persistence

### Analytical Capabilities

* Performance summaries and win-rate metrics
* Rating progression and temporal trends
* Opponent strength segmentation
* Opening-level outcome analysis
* Time control and colour-based performance views

### Predictive Modelling

* Lightweight logistic regression model
* Win probability estimates based on rating difference and colour
* Intended for intuition and comparison

### Interface

* Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
* Plotly visualisations
* Structured separation of data ingestion, analysis, and exploration

## Limitations

* Manual data retrieval only
* Dependent on Chess.com public data availability and rate limits
